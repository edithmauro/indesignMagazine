# indesignMagazine
Magazine layout made using Adobe InDesign for a course project.  The project was to create a magazine including a written research paper, subcover, and original magazine design.  This pdf includes the main cover, sub cover, inside text, and back cover.  

My work includes pages 1, 15-17, and 20 (front cover, "Religion is a Necessity for Bigger's Sanity, and the back cover)
